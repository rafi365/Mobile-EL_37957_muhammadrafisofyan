    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=A0:C5:12:D8:9F:33:30:36:60:AE:64:0E:E1:00:95:BA:A8:88:0C:EA%3Bumn.ac.id.week13_37957

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    umn.ac.id.week13_37957

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    A0:C5:12:D8:9F:33:30:36:60:AE:64:0E:E1:00:95:BA:A8:88:0C:EA

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
